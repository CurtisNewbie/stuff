prompt = """
Your task is to create a short but context rich summary of the conversation so far, paying close attention to the user's explicit requests and your previous actions.

Record current task progress in PROGRESS.md in root directory.

This summary should be thorough in capturing user's requests, intents, interests and requirements that would be essential for creating a new conversation without losing context.

Make the summary as concise as possible but context rich.

If the PROGRESS.md already exists, review the PROGRESS.md, remove outdated, irrelavant information and rewrite certain notes, such that the file size wouldn't grow indefinitely.

While you recorded your progress. Update AGENTS.md for importants things that must be remembered, but try not to put everything in it, create separate docs if necessary.
