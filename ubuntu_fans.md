# Fans Controll for Ubuntu

Prob Alienware alpha to display the fans speed:

```
sudo modprobe dell-smm-hwmon force=1
```

Thins to install:

- lm-sensors
- fanscontrol

When lm-sensors is intalled, run `sudo sensors-detect` first, select YES for all options, and may be reboot.

Then run `sudo pwmconfig` to test sensors and configure fan speed (pwm), after configuration, select save-and-exit.

In this case, we already have configuration setup, we run `sudo fancontrol` to actually apply the control of fans.


For the first time, the config file in `/etc/fancontrol` generated by pwmconfig is as follows:

```
INTERVAL=10
DEVPATH=hwmon3= 
DEVNAME=hwmon3=dell_smm 
FCTEMPS=hwmon3/pwm2=hwmon3/temp2_input hwmon3/pwm1=hwmon3/temp1_input
FCFANS=hwmon3/pwm2=hwmon3/fan2_input hwmon3/pwm1=hwmon3/fan1_input
MINTEMP=hwmon3/pwm2=45 hwmon3/pwm1=45
MAXTEMP=hwmon3/pwm2=70 hwmon3/pwm1=70 
MINSTART=hwmon3/pwm2=150 hwmon3/pwm1=150 
MINSTOP=hwmon3/pwm2=0 hwmon3/pwm1=0 
MAXPWM=hwmon3/pwm2=255 hwmon3/pwm1=255 
```

The configuration may be lost if `hwmon3` is changed (on reboot), so we replace it with actual path (plus some regex in it)

Because we have run pwmconfig, we known that `hwmon3` is the one we are looking for, we try to find its actual path (which is also a symbolic link)

```
ls /sys/class/hwmon/ -al
```

We notice that its' path is actually "/sys/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon3", then we change the config file as follows:

```
INTERVAL=10
FCTEMPS= /sys/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon[[:print:]]*/pwm2=/sys/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon[[:print:]]*/temp2_input /sys/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon[[:print:]]*/pwm1=/sys/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon[[:print:]]*/temp1_input
FCFANS= /sys/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon[[:print:]]*/pwm2=/sys/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon[[:print:]]*/fan2_input /sys/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon[[:print:]]*/pwm1=/sys/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon[[:print:]]*/fan1_input
MINTEMP= /sys/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon[[:print:]]*/pwm2=45 /sys/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon[[:print:]]*/pwm1=45
MAXTEMP= /sys/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon[[:print:]]*/pwm2=70 /sys/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon[[:print:]]*/pwm1=70 
MINSTART= /sys/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon[[:print:]]*/pwm2=150 /sys/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon[[:print:]]*/pwm1=150 
MINSTOP= /sys/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon[[:print:]]*/pwm2=0 /sys/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon[[:print:]]*/pwm1=0 
MAXPWM= /sys/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon[[:print:]]*/pwm2=255 /sys/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon[[:print:]]*/pwm1=255 
```

Run `sudo systemctl enable fancontrol` to enable fancontrol as service.

To always prob (load) the module dell-smm-hwmon on startup. 

Create file `/etc/modules-load.d/dell-smm-hwmon.conf` with content: 

```
dell-smm-hwmon
```

This file is only used to laod the module, so it doesn't contain parameters.

And then we create file `/etc/modprobe.d/dell-smm-hwmon.conf` with content: 

```
options dell-smm-hwmon force=1
````

This file specify the parameters that the kernal will use to load the module.
